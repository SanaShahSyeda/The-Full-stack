---------------->> Absolute unit

* Absolute units are constant across different devices and have a fixed size. They are useful for activities like printing a page. They are not so suitable when it comes to the wide variety of devices in use today that have different viewport sizes. Because of this, absolute units are used when the size of the web page is known and will remain constant. 



---------------->> Relative values.

* Relative values are defined ‘in relation’ to the other elements present inside the parent element. Additionally, they are defined ‘in relation’ to the viewport or the size of the visible web page. Given the dynamic nature of web pages today and the variable size of devices in use, relative units are the go-to option in many cases.
