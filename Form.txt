--------->>: Form validation

1: Client-side validation:

* checks errors as text is typed in form.
* done through JS.


2: Server-side validation: 

* form data received by web server, backend validates data before processing.




---------->>: 2 ways, form can send data to server

1: Get: 

* data appended at end of http url.
# 3 problems:
1-- URl length limited by browser.
2-- URl length limited by server.
3-- Security threats.

2: Post:

* form data inserted into content of http request.
* more secure than get method.
* HTTPS used for complete security in which only sender and receiver can understand data.
